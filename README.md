I have used two scripts Server.py to serve data by sending an invitation to the client, and Host.py to receive data on acceptance of the invitation.
After accepting the invitation, both server and client share messages mutually.
Socket (or network socket) is a module used to communicate between two computers.
It provides two types of interface to access the network, namely low-level (platform dependent connections — Example: Telnet) and high-level (application dependent connections — Example: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.).
This is a simple tutorial to establish the low-level socket connection between server and client to communicate messages using the TCP/IP protocol.
